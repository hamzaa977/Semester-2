//type casting:
// the process of converting one data type to another.  like to convert int data type into string.

//here is the code:



#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    a=45;
    string b="hamza";

//syntax=   to_string(variable name)
    cout<<to_string(a)<<endl;
//here variable a was the integer datatype , by type casting it is converted into string.
return 0;
}
